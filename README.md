# QuickShare
###### An app built on Django &amp; ReactJs for quick sharing of text and documents locally between different platforms
QuickShare solves a simple issue of sharing text (like links, snippets, etc) and documents between different paltforms. For sharing such 
information we often rely on messaging apps like Whatsapp or Messenger. But in case of poor internet connection we may have to 
wait for a longer time. QuickShare is developed keeping this in mind and is a better alternative in such cases. It is 
designed to work in a local network and it has a web interface for cross platform functionality.
## Features
* you can share unlimited text (preserves every space and layout, makes it ideal for sharing codes) .
* you can share upto ten files in one go. Supports every file format like .txt .doc .pdf .mp3 .mkv .mp4, etc.
* server stores the uploads until you delete it.
* simple and minimalistic web interface.
* accessible from any browser.
##### little tweaks in the os and browser settings will be helpful in increasing productivity
* add a webpage shortcut to home screen from browser. 
* set a static ipv4 address for the host system in the home network.
* setup a shell script to activate the server and attach it with bash.rc, so that a simple command can trigger the script.
